# Notes_App
Build A Notes App in HTML CSS &amp; JavaScript 
In this note app, users can easily add, edit, or delete their notes. The notes user has added to this app will be stored in the browser’s local storage so, they won’t remove on page refresh or tab close, and it is done with pure JavaScript.
